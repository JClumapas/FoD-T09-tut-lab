Assignment 2
please add comments here if neccessary

Drac:
- METHOD A: camp to gain HP then run
keep moving around castle - starting from castle->hide->klausenburg->galatz->double back to CD->no legal moves so "teleports" to CD->rinse repeat
When hunter is within 3 moves, then run from the nearest hunter (assess distance to all hunters and make a move)
advantages: gets lots of HP if hunters start far away
disadvantages: if hunters start near the castle, then basically fucked
- METHOD B: don't reveal location
run from the nearest hunter, but avoid castle, avoid seas, avoid double-backing
advantages and disadvantages: opposite of method A

Hunters:
 - Start spread out, conduct research
 - all hunters move towards hunter nearest to dracula
 - otherwise move randomly
